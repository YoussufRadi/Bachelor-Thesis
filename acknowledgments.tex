I want to thank my director, Prof. Dr. Dirk Reichardt, for his direction and support all through the entire journey of the bachelor project and thesis. Also I want to express my gratitude to M.Sc. Ahmed Elnaggar who is one of the main factors for the completion of this project.  

Moreover, I would like to give my appreciation to my friends for their understanding, support, and confidence in me consistently. 

Finally, leaving the best till the end; My family, I would not have the chance to do this ace course without their help and support, so I would like to express my greatest gratitude toward them.
